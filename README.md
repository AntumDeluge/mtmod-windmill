This works only with latest git of Minetest (ass of 16.10.13).
With older versions, you'll only see a one node large rotor.

Crafting: steel_ingot  -nothing-  steel_ingot
                         stick               
          steel_ingot  -nothing-  steel_ingot

Clockwise- and counterclockwise rotating rotors can be crafted into each other.


NEW: Windmill sails for historic windmills:

Crafting: white wool   -nothing-  white wool 
                         stick               
          white wool   -nothing-  white wool 


The axis is mostly a decorative node to which you can attach your mill rotors.
